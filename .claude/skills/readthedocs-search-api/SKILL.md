# Read the Docs Search API

Query the public Read the Docs Search API to find documentation across millions of pages.

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Make a search request

Query the API using:
```
GET https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q={query}&page={page}
```

Required parameters:
- `q`: Your search query (e.g., "authentication", "API pagination")
- `page`: Result page number (default: 1)

Note on scoping: You will generally get better and more consistent results by scoping your query to a specific project. Use fielded search syntax inside `q`, for example `project:{project-slug} your terms`.
Examples: `project:docs build`, `project:sphinx configuration`.

### 2. Parse the response

The API returns JSON with this structure:
```json
{
  "count": 1234,
  "next": "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=query&page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "project-name:doc-title",
      "project": "project-name",
      "version": "latest",
      "title": "Documentation Title",
      "path": "/en/latest/path/to/page.html",
      "domain": "project-name.readthedocs.io",
      "highlight": "snippet of matching <mark>text</mark>...",
      "blocks": [
        {
          "id": "section-id",
          "title": "Section Title",
          "path": "/path#section-id"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Handle pagination

If there are more results, use the `next` URL to fetch the next page. Continue until `next` is null.

## Examples

### Search for authentication documentation
```bash
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=authentication"
```

### Search within a specific project
```bash
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=project:docs%20authentication"
```

### Project-scoped quick queries
```bash
# Sphinx
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=project:sphinx%20configuration"
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=project:sphinx%20autodoc"

# Requests
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=project:requests%20proxies"
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=project:requests%20authentication"

# Read the Docs
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=project:readthedocs%20build"
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=project:readthedocs%20redirects"
```

### Search with pagination
```bash
curl "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/?q=API&page=2"
```

### Parse results with Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/",
    params={"q": "REST API"}
)

data = response.json()
for result in data['results']:
    print(f"{result['project']}: {result['title']}")
    print(f"  Domain: {result['domain']}")
    print(f"  Path: {result['path']}")
```

### Get all paginated results
```python
def search_all(query):
    all_results = []
    page = 1
    while True:
        response = requests.get(
            "https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/",
            params={"q": query, "page": page}
        )
        data = response.json()
        all_results.extend(data['results'])
        if not data['next']:
            break
        page += 1
    return all_results
```

## Common edge cases

**No authentication required**: The Search API is public and does not require API keys or authentication.

**Rate limiting**: The API applies reasonable rate limits. If you receive HTTP 429, implement exponential backoff.

**Private documentation excluded**: Only publicly available documentation is searchable. Private projects are not included.

**Search delay**: The search index updates with a slight delay. New documentation may not appear immediately.

**Empty results**: If a query returns no results, try simpler keywords or browse the project directly on Read the Docs.

**Project scoping recommended**: The global index is large and queries can be broad. For most use cases, include a `project:{project-slug}` filter in `q` to scope results to the relevant documentation project.
